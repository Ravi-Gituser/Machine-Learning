# Machine-Learning

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

# Machine Learning Techniques 
   * Regression
   * Classification
   * Clustering
   * Anomaly Detection
   * Reinforcement learning

 Machine Learning models - Machine Learning models are mainly classified as - Supervised , Unsupervised and Reinforced models.
   * Supervised - Data is labelled.
      Ex - Linear regression , Polynomial regression , Decision trees , Random forest ,  K nearest neighbours(KNN) , Naive Bayes theorem ,            Support vector machines(SVM).
   * Unsupervised - Data is not labelled.
      Ex - K means clustering , Apriori , Hidden Markov model.
   * Reinforced - Model learns from past errors and corrects in the next iteration.This is used for deep learning applications like self        driving cars , chatbots , computer vision , image/object detection etc.

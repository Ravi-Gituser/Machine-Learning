# Machine-Learning

This branch consists of sub-branches:

a) Machine Learning models - Machine Learning models are mainly classiied as - Supervised , Unsupervised and Reinforced models.
   * Supervised - Data is labelled.
      Ex - Linear regression , Polynomial regression , Decision trees , Random forest ,  K nearest neighbours(KNN) , Naive Bayes theorem ,            Support vector machines(SVM).
   * Unsupervised - Data is not labelled.
      Ex - K means clustering , Apriori , Hidden Markov model.
   * Reinforced - Model learns from past errors and corrects in the next iteration.
   
b) Matplotlib - This sub-branch features various examples in a Jupyter(iPython) notebook to plot graphs using the Matplotlib library.

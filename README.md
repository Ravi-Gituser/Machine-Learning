# Machine-Learning

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Machine Learning Techniques 
   * Regression
   * Classification
   * Clustering
   * Anomaly Detection
   * Reinforcement learning

 Machine Learning models - Machine Learning models are mainly classified as - Supervised , Unsupervised and Reinforced models.
 
 ##  Supervised 
     The data is labelled in the form of feature columns. Two most popular techniques of Supervised learning are :
                * Regression This technique is generally used for variables that are continuous in nature.In other words they can                           have infinite number of values. Ex - temperature , price of an item etc.
                * Classification - This technique is used where the variable values are finite in nature.In other words the outcome can be                   any one among a fixed set of values. Ex - Is it raining outside ? , Who won the match ? , How many varieties of mangoes                   are available etc.
      Supervised models - Linear regression , Polynomial regression , Decision trees , Random forest ,  K nearest neighbours(KNN) , Naive       Bayes theorem ,  Support vector machines(SVM).
      
 ##  Unsupervised
     Here the data is not labelled.The model is trained to find hidden patterns from the data that cannot be deciphered by                      humans.
                  One of the widely used technique of Unsupervised learning is 'Clustering'.
                * Clustering - Clustering is a technique where the entire unlabelled data is broadly categorised into different                             clusters/sectors depending on the similarity of each data point.
      Unsupervised models - K means clustering , Apriori , Hidden Markov model.
      
   ## Reinforced 
      Model learns from past errors and corrects in the next iteration.This is used for deep learning applications like self                     driving cars , chatbots , recommender systems , computer vision , image/object detection etc.
